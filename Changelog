Changelog:

0.1 - created from frags of code from my aborted sound editor.

0.2 - changed name to wavnorm, added -r option, cleaned up code,
      added GPL and README

0.3 - Cleaned up error checking, now handles more than one wav file on
      the command line, made the output of the program saner.

0.4 - Wrote nrecord and nplay, modularised the code further, added the
      fix wav length function, etc. Put this in a seperate file and
      put everything under CVS.

0.5 - Added updates and manpages from Jorgen Grahn <jgrahn@algonet.se>
    - Lost CVS tree due to various software changes I won't go into, so
      took out the CVS stuff for now.
    - Added improvements to wavnorm from Frederik Arbeiter 
      <frederik.arbeiter@gmx.net>, see
      http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ualy/software/wavlevel/wavlevel.html
      for wavlevel, his handy package!
    - Also added suggestions by Chad Hurwitz <churritz@king.cts.com>,
      regarding allowing some clipping to occur in a controlled manner.
      Part of this also includes a simple display of where the peaks
      occur in the file, handy for choosing compression or choosing
      how many clips to include. Still unsure of the usefulness of this
      code however. 
    - Added scaling function as in the patch sent in by Attila Bogar,
      <boat@elte.hu>
    - Added a little % progress thingy which is better than how it was
      before.
